### Description
This project is a part of Techtonica's curriculum ([source]("https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/tree/main/projects/eventonica")), where the goal is to make an event management web application. The app will "let users browse from a variety of events and save the ones they are interested in." The final product will be a full-stack web app thats uses ReactJS and a database.

The project is split into seven parts.

### Progress

- Models.js has three main classes: Eventonica, Event, and User. They have basic implementations for now.
  - At this time I won't worry about event location and time
  - The findByDate and event.date is somewhat inconsistent, but I think that once I finalize the input format, it should be easier to debug
- Jasmine tests are partially setup (formally part 2, now part 7)
