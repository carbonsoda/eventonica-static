### Description
This project is a part of Techtonica's curriculum ([source]("https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/tree/main/projects/eventonica")), where the goal is to make an event management web application. The app will "let users browse from a variety of events and save the ones they are interested in." The final product will be a full-stack web app thats uses ReactJS and a database.

The project is split into seven parts.

### Progress:
- User and event classes are set for now, but Eventonica still needs work on event support.
- Jasmine tests are partially setup (formally part 2, now part 7)
